There are two purposes in this assignment. The first purpose is to design a system that can detect license and vulnerability information for an Open Source Software. The second purpose is to compare the identified license and vulnerability information against the policies of a company. In this system, the developer downloads a software package to be installed onto his or her computer. The software package then gets scanned through the License Scanner to check for license information of that software package. It also gets scanned through the NIST Vulnerability Database in order to check for vulnerability information of a particular software package. The NIST Vulnerability Database returns the vulnerability information back to the developer. The License Scanner returns the license information back to the developer. After that, the Management process writes license and vulnerability information to the License and Vulnerabilities Database Query, which returns it to the License and Vulnerabilities Database. Since the developer wants to know the results of the license and vulnerability information of a software package that he or she downloaded, the developer actually requests that the results from the License and Vulnerabilities Database Query be updated to him or her. 

There is also a manager in this system. The manager's job is to
